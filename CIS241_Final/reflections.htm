<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">I
have very much enjoyed CIS241 Web Design 1. I found that online courses
such as this one have a different learning style as comparted to
traditional in class courses. I like learning through the online
courses offered by EDCC, especially classes in subjects on computers
and technology. While learning the material in this course, there were
many times I was like “so that’s how they do it”. <br>Other things
once learned in the web design curriculum I began to notice while using
the internet. Image formats were great to learn, as I see images now on
the web and go “that must be a GIF”. Or I’ll see different monitors and
think how images would be displayed on them and how their size and
resolution effects image presentation.<br>One of the biggest "Ah ha!"
moments I had in this course was when I began to understand HTML. I
would see a webpages code and start to understand the different parts
of the page how it functions. This course was very interesting and full
of “Ah ha, so that’s how they do it!” moments, and I look forward to
many more in Web Design 2 this winter.<br></body></html>
