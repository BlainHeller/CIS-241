</big>I
love music! I play Bass Guitar and Bari Saxophone, in small groups and
community bands. The last group I played in was the Beethoven German
Band in <a href="https://www.cityofwasilla.com/" target="_blank">San Antonio TX</a>. I have worked for two music stores, <a href="http://www.kennellykeysmusic.com/locations/lynnwood/" target="_blank">Kennelly
Keys Music</a> in <a href="http://www.lynnwoodwa.gov/">Lynnwood WA</a>, and Matanuska Music in <a href="https://www.cityofwasilla.com/" target="_blank">Wasilla AK</a>.</p>

</big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Food</span><br>There is so much great food in Seattle! With so many great
choices, it can hard to pick. There are many good restaurants with a wide verity
of foods. Being in the northwest, the Seattle area has access to great seafood,
amazing local produce from around Washington, and locally sourced meats. Going
out for a culinary adventure or staying home to cook awesome northwest ingredients
are both great options and I very much like them both. <o:p></o:p>
<br><br><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Travel</span><br>I
very much enjoy getting out of town and exploring Washington State and
the pacific northwest. I also really like to stay in town with a
seemingly endless array of things to do and see.&nbsp; I have lived in
Seattle for around four years now, and I think itâ€™s one of the very
best cities. When traveling, trying the local food is a must!
Experiencing new places is great, and when you get home you appreciate
it here that much more.<br><br><br>
