<p style="margin-left: 0px; width: 996px;">Hello, and
welcome to my website! My name is Blain Heller. This website
is designed for the CIS241 final project.</p>
<br>
<p>I am currently a student at Edmonds Community Collage. I am in
the <a href="http://catalog.edcc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=52&amp;poid=10376&amp;returnto=14813" target="_blank">Web Application and Cloud Development</a>
program. I like computers and the web, and I enjoy learning about art,
science, and technology. The main reasons I attendant EDCC is to learn
web design and technology, and to learn in a tech savvy environment. In
addition to the classes and degrees offered, one of the main things
that drew me to Edmonds Community Collage is its location. Lynnwood and
the neighboring areas are beautiful and have a lot to offer. There is
much technology and natural beauty in this area, and EDCC and its CIS
program allow me to live, learn, and work in this great place!&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>I currently work in Lynnwood WA at a company that sells, rents
and repairs musical instruments. I have worked in the musical
instrument field since 2009, when I started at a small shop in Wasilla,
AK. Since then, I have worked in several different positions within the
field including sales, repair, and web design. I started out in
instrument sales and rentals. This led to many opportunities to
interact with interesting people from the community. I learned to
repair band instruments on the job, and I earned a certificate in band
instrument repair from Renton Technical Collage.</p><p style="margin-top: 16px; height: 80px;">After
completing the CIS program at Edmonds CC, my goal is a carrier in Web
development. I have many professional interests in a verity of areas to
apply design skills learned at EDCC, and I am open to new professional
opportunities. I have enjoyed learning at Edmonds CC in the Web
Application and Cloud Development program, and I look forward to
continuing my learning and finishing my degree.
